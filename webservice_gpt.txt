## explanation of request function ##

In Flask, the request object is a global object that represents the HTTP 
request made by the client to the server. It contains information about the request, 
such as the HTTP method (e.g. GET, POST, etc.), the URL path, the headers, and any data 
that was sent in the request body.

The request object is created automatically by Flask 
when a request is received, and it is available in the context 
of a Flask route function. In order to access the data from the request, 
you can use various methods provided by the request object. 
Here are some commonly used methods:

request.method: returns the HTTP method used in the request (e.g. "GET" or "POST").
request.url: returns the URL of the request.
request.args: returns a dictionary-like object containing the query string parameters of the request.
request.form: returns a dictionary-like object containing the form data submitted in a POST request.
request.json: returns a dictionary-like object containing the JSON data submitted in the request body.

For example, in a Flask route function, you can access the value 
of a query string parameter using request.args.get("param_name"). 
This will return the value of the query string parameter 
with the name "param_name", or None if the parameter is not present in the request.

Overall, the request object is an important component of Flask 
that allows you to access and manipulate the data sent by the client in an 
HTTP request.

<script> tags are used to include JavaScript files or 
code within an HTML page. In this case, we're using the src 
attribute to specify the location of the jQuery library file, 
which is hosted on the Google CDN (Content Delivery Network).

CDNs are networks of servers that are distributed geographically 
and work together to provide fast and reliable content 
delivery to users. By including the jQuery library from the Google CDN, 
we can reduce the load on our own server and provide a faster and 
more reliable experience for our users.

The jquery.min.js file is the minified version of the jQuery library, 
which means that the file size is reduced by removing whitespace 
and comments. This helps to improve page load times, as smaller files 
can be downloaded more quickly.

Once the jQuery library is included in the HTML file, 
we can use its functionality to simplify DOM manipulation and AJAX 
requests in our JavaScript code.


DOM manipulation and AJAX requests are two common tasks 
performed by JavaScript when building dynamic web applications.

DOM manipulation refers to the process of updating the 
Document Object Model (DOM) of a web page using JavaScript. 
The DOM is a hierarchical representation of the elements and 
content on a web page, and it can be manipulated using JavaScript to 
dynamically update the content, structure, and style of the page. 
For example, we might use DOM manipulation to add a new element 
to the page, change the text content of an existing element, 
or update the CSS style of an element based on user input.

AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a technique for making 
asynchronous HTTP requests from a web page using JavaScript. 
With AJAX, we can send data to and receive data from a web server 
without having to reload the entire page. This allows for a more 
responsive and interactive user experience, as we can update parts 
of the page dynamically without interrupting the user's flow.
AJAX requests can be used to retrieve data from a server, 
submit form data, or perform other tasks without requiring 
a full page refresh.

jQuery is a JavaScript library that provides a simplified API 
for working with the DOM and making AJAX requests. 
By using jQuery, we can write less code and achieve the same 
results more quickly and easily than using vanilla JavaScript. 
For example, jQuery provides methods like append() and html() for 
manipulating the DOM, and methods like get() and post() for making 
AJAX requests.



jQuery is a popular open-source JavaScript library 
that simplifies HTML document traversal and manipulation, 
event handling, and AJAX-based communication 
for web development. It is designed to make it easier to 
navigate a document, select elements, manipulate their attributes 
and content, and handle events.

jQuery provides a simple and efficient way to write JavaScript code 
that works across different browsers, and reduces the amount of code 
required for common web development tasks. It includes a rich set of 
functions and utilities that can be used to perform various operations 
on the Document Object Model (DOM), such as creating and modifying 
HTML elements, handling user input, and making AJAX requests.

Some common features of jQuery include:

- Selecting elements in the DOM using CSS-style selectors.
- Manipulating HTML content and attributes of elements.
- Handling events such as mouse clicks and keyboard input.
- Animating elements and creating visual effects.
- Making AJAX requests to the server and updating the page 
with the response data.

jQuery is widely used in web development and is supported by a 
large community of developers. It is also compatible with many plugins 
and other libraries, making it a versatile tool for creating dynamic 
and interactive web pages.



In the context of the code you provided, 
$ is an alias for the global jQuery function.

jQuery is a JavaScript library that provides a 
simplified API for working with the DOM and making AJAX requests. 

The $ function is the primary way to access jQuery functionality, 
and it's used to select DOM elements, manipulate their properties, 
and register event handlers. For example, 

the expression $("#user_input") uses the $ function to select the 
DOM element with id="user_input".

The $ function can also be used to create new DOM elements 
and apply CSS styles, among other things.

In summary, $ is a shorthand for the jQuery function, 
which provides a convenient way to interact with the DOM and make AJAX requests in JavaScript.



###################################


$.get("/get", {msg: user_input}).done(function(data) { ... });


This line of code is making an AJAX request to the server 
using the jQuery `$.get()` method. The `$.get()` method is a 
shorthand method for making a GET request to the specified URL.

The first argument of the `$.get()` method is the URL 
to which the request will be sent. In this case, it is `"/get"`, 
which matches the route that we defined in Flask.

The second argument is an object containing 
any data that should be sent with the request. 
In this case, we are sending a key-value pair where the key is "msg" 
and the value is the user's input.

The `$.get()` method returns a Promise object that can be used to 
handle the response from the server. The `.done()` method is called 
when the request is successful and the server responds with a result. 
The `data` argument of the `.done()` function contains 
the response data returned by the server.

In our case, the response from the server is the bot's 
response to the user's input. The `data` argument is 
used to append the bot's response to the message area 
of the web page, as shown in the following line of code: 

```
$("#message_area").append("<p><b>Bot:</b> " + data + "</p>");
```

Overall, this line of code is responsible for sending 
the user's input to the server and receiving the bot's response, 
and then appending the response to the message area of the web page.
